# Problem Set 1
 
First problem set! September 19, 2019

1.1

I copy and pasted the int main function and all of its arguments, which I don't understand, into my new problem set, and then declared three kinds of variables, an integer, a float, and a character, and learned the minutia of maintaining syntax...

I then used a printf() command to print these variables in reverse order.

1.2

I used the same basic format for the program, but then deleted the contents of the main function and started over.
I used afplay -h to figure out how to arrange the arguments. I put a playback rate of 2 for the mp3 file I put in the folder.

1.3

I used the \n the make a line break and figured out where spaces are acceptable so that I can get all the plusses to be in line perfectly.
